Changes in 2.0
==============
Made major corrections to the algorithms for both BloomFilter and
ScalableBloomFilter. Not numerically compatible with serialized
representations of filters from previous versions. Specifically,
BloomFilter was more accurate than requested and ScalableBloomFilter
was much less accurate than requested.

Changes in 1.1

Added copy, intersection and union functions to BloomFilter
