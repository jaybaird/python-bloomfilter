Changes in 3.0.0
================
Backward incompatible change: dropped the support of Python 2.6.
Fix an BytesIO issues that prevents Python 2.7 from serialising a filter.

Changes in 2.3.2
==============
Added hash function to the filter instance.

Changes in 2.3.1
==============
Added union functionality to ScalableBloomFilter.

Changes in 2.2
==============
Replaced the xrange by count, so it is a iterator now.
This fixes overflow error when a large integer is passed
the range_fun.

Changes in 2.1
==============
The tightening ratio is 0.9, and it is consistently used.
Choosing r around 0.8 - 0.9 will result in better average
space usage for wide range of growth, therefore the default
value of mode is set to LARGE_SET_GROWTH.

Changes in 2.0
==============
Made major corrections to the algorithms for both BloomFilter and
ScalableBloomFilter. Not numerically compatible with serialized
representations of filters from previous versions. Specifically,
BloomFilter was more accurate than requested and ScalableBloomFilter
was much less accurate than requested.

Changes in 1.1
==============
Added copy, intersection and union functions to BloomFilter
