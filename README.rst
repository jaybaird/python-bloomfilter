This ``bloom filter`` is forked from ``pybloom``, and its tightening ratio is changed to 0.9 and this ration is consistently used.
Choosing r around 0.8 - 0.9 will result in better average space usage for wide range of growth, therefore the default value of model is set to LARGE_SET_GROWTH.
This is a module that includes a Bloom Filter data structure along with an implementation of Scalable Bloom Filters as discussed in:

P. Almeida, C.Baquero, N. Preguiça, D. Hutchison, Scalable Bloom Filters,
(GLOBECOM 2007), IEEE, 2007.

Bloom filters are great if you understand what amount of bits you need to set
aside early to store your entire set. Scalable Bloom Filters allow your bloom
filter bits to grow as a function of false positive probability and size.

A filter is "full" when at capacity: M * ((ln 2 ^ 2) / abs(ln p)), where M
is the number of bits and p is the false positive probability. When capacity
is reached a new filter is then created exponentially larger than the last
with a tighter probability of false positives and a larger number of hash
functions.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pybloom import BloomFilter
    >>> f = BloomFilter(capacity=1000, error_rate=0.001)
    >>> [f.add(x) for x in range(10)]
    [False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]
    >>> all([(x in f) for x in range(10)])
    True
    >>> 10 in f
    False
    >>> 5 in f
    True
    >>> f = BloomFilter(capacity=1000, error_rate=0.001)
    >>> for i in xrange(0, f.capacity):
    ...     _ = f.add(i)
    >>> (1.0 - (len(f) / float(f.capacity))) <= f.error_rate + 2e-18
    True

    >>> from pybloom import ScalableBloomFilter
    >>> sbf = ScalableBloomFilter(mode=ScalableBloomFilter.SMALL_SET_GROWTH)
    >>> count = 10000
    >>> for i in xrange(0, count):
    ...     _ = sbf.add(i)
    ...
    >>> (1.0 - (len(sbf) / float(count))) <= sbf.error_rate + 2e-18
    True

    # len(sbf) may not equal the entire input length. 0.01% error is well
    # below the default 0.1% error threshold. As the capacity goes up, the
    # error will approach 0.1%.

We follow this `git branching model <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_, please have a look at it.
